    👋 Hi, I’m Brian, a pharmacist gearing towards software development!
    👀 I’m interested in Web applications and services and would eventually love to learn more about AI and machine learning.
    🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, HTML.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! All projects are welcome while I'm still exploring my passions! Would be especially interested in a combination of software development and the medical field.
